#### Hi, my name is Danil Zakablukovskii.

I'm a backend developer + a bit frontend. Though my current job-title is "Senior Software Engineer", ha-ha.

Currently I work on the interesting project, that is already second one that is related to the music industry, named [Spinitron](spinitron.com){:target="_blank"}.  
Here we create/upgrade a report-/tracking-/analytic-system for non-commercial radio-stations.

Created with Jekyll (and few sleepless nights), hosted on Github.
