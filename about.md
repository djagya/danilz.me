### Hi, my name is Danil Zakablukovskii.

I'm a backend developer. Potentially a full-stack developer too, but frontend stuff is not my strong side (though
I understand how important is frontend part nowadays).

Currently I work on the interesting project named [Spinitron](spinitron.com){:target="_blank"}. We're upgrading old framework-less project to
the new Yii2 framework.

My main tech stack is:

<dl>
    <dt>Backend:</dt>
    <dd>
    PHP, Yii/Yii2 frameworks, Laravel framework, Redis (for different purposes from queues to storage for AR), MySql, a bit of PostgreSQL
    </dd>

    <dt>Frontend:</dt>
    <dd>HTML (HTML5), JS (es6), CSS (SCSS, Less), jQuery, templates(Handlebars.js, etc)</dd>

    <dt>Server:</dt>
    <dd>Linux, Ansible, MySQL, nginx, Apache, sphinx, Bash</dd>

    <dt>Other:</dt>
    <dd>
      React.js + Flux (I really interested and i'm trying to use/learn/understand that), Git, Webpack, Bower,
      Ruby, RoR, Node.js, Socket.io, Grunt, TDD, MVC, queues, API, social services (FB, Twitter, Google/YouTube,
      SoundCloud, etc)
    </dd>
</dl>

I love (<3) reading, there are some favorite IT-related books I have and reread sometimes:

- ["Code Complete"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/){:target: "_blank"}
- ["The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/){:target: "_blank"}
- ["Introduction to Algorithms"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/){:target: "_blank"} (ha-ha, who am I kidding?)

Also I like to make and mix some music (but actually didn't do anything real yet).  
I really like studying, new knowledge, interesting and difficult things/tasks.  
Mathematics, Physic, Biology, Astronomy - these branches of science have always interested me.
